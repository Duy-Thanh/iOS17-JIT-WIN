# Issues
If you run into any problems or if anything in my instructions is unclear, feel free to open an issue :)  
Here are some common troubleshooting tips though:  
- Reboot your PC. Use the restart button, shutting down and starting again isn't the same.
- make sure to use a high quality cable. The default apple one should be fine. 

# License
Feel free to do whatever you want with my code. Please note that everything installed by install.bat might be under other licenses. Also, there's absolutely no warranty or anything.
